# MNIST Image Classification using Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This GitHub project focuses on developing deep learning model for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits (0-9) and is commonly used as a benchmark for testing various machine learning algorithms. 

The objective is to implement both a conventional Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate digit recognition and comparison.
## Key Features
- Data Collection:
The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which is available through popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Model Architecture:
- Neural Network: A traditional feedforward neural network with fully connected layers for image classification.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Utilizes convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical features from the input images.
Training and Evaluation: Implements training routines for both models and evaluates their performance using metrics like accuracy.


## Algorithms Implementation
The following deep learning architectures have been implemented:

- Fully connected Neural Network:
A standard feedforward neural network with multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. This architecture learns to map input images to corresponding digit labels.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
Leverages convolutional layers to capture spatial hierarchies in the input images. CNNs are particularly effective for image-related tasks, enabling automatic feature extraction.
